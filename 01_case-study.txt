      As a software engineer involved in the project, I will force my team to comply with the task that was assigned to us and accomplish it according to deadlines that are in accordance with it. In this case, we are required to accomplish the tasks properly. The development of a project must start with the date it was given, and we must provide progress every day up to the deadline. Given the time it is being developed, the IT department must ensure the quality of the project; the errors or bugs must be resolved; and the project must be properly working before its launch. After the development, testing is the crucial part that must be executed. In this part, we must ensure the program is properly working, and all the problems must be resolved. If there are complications during the testing phase, we must fix them immediately and ensure that it will perform and execute correctly. During those phases, there must be no wasted time, and the development must be in line with the proposed project plan. In addition, the plan will only be properly achieved if all the people involved in the project are properly working on it.
